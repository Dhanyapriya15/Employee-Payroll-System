# Employee-Payroll-System
This is a console-based Employee Payroll System developed in Java using object-oriented programming principles. It defines an abstract Employee class with common attributes and an abstract method for salary calculation. Two subclasses—FullTimeEmployee and PartTimeEmployee—override the method with their respective logic. A PayrollSystem class manages adding, removing, and displaying employee details. The output is elegantly formatted in a tabular structure for clarity, showcasing names, IDs, and salaries. The project demonstrates abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation effectively without using external files or GUI.
